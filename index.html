      A Quick Summary
    </h2>
    <p class="tldr">
      If you have an idea that you’d like to implement, talk to Alin. Spontaneous acts and gifts can be retroactively reimbursed, whereas planned experiences (preferably) will be paid in advance, or directly from Neontribe. Small spontaneous ideas require no review, but guidelines
      are below if you're stuck. Suitable planned experiences are those which <b>involve at least one other member of staff</b> (priority is generally given to projects which involve multiple), that are <b> fun (for them)</b>, and preferably either <b>contribute to
      their wellbeing, nurture social connections within the Tribe or involve team-building activities.</b> Any gift is considered suitable if it can be reasonably justified.
      <br>
      <br> A list of past experiences to inspire you is provided below and will be maintained as regularly as reasonably possible.

    <h2>Guidelines</h2>
    <div class="content guidelines">

      <p>The use of the fun budget can be roughly split into two categories: spontaneous and planned experiences.</p>

      <h3>Spontaneous Experiences (and Gifts)</h3>
      <p>A spontaneous experience can be roughly defined as an activity that takes place on the same day it is suggested. Purchasing a gift for another Triber also falls under this category. Examples might include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Buying ice cream for the office on a hot day</li>
        <li>Buying an item from a charity shop and gifting it to a colleague</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Spontaneous activities are usually quick, cheap and, well, spontaneous. They are intended to occur when someone sees something nice, and wants to share it with other Tribers.
      Note that it is not required to involve everyone with something spontaneous, although it is always nice to offer. It's all about togetherness! If it’s something that’s going to use a moderate percentage of the budget, it is best to check with Neil (or Alin) first, it only takes a few moments to make a phone call.</p>
      <p>Reimbursement for spontaneous experiences and gifts is easy - all you need to do is talk to Alin/Neil: send Alin (and Neil in CC) the total cost via email with a copy of the receipt(s)</p>


      <h3>Planned Experiences</h3>
      <p> Planned experiences usually take time out of work to do, such as a workshop or escape room. Much of the same rules apply to planned experiences as to spontaneous ones, however there are some differences which will be listed below.
        <br>
        <br>The general guideline for suitable planned experiences are ones that involve at least <b>two</b> colleagues and are fun for them, in addition to at least one of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>contribute to their well being (e.g. nature walk with a picnic basket, employee appreciation day with pizza)</li>
        <li>nurture social connections (e.g. birthday karaoke outing)</li>
        <li>involve team building activities (e.g. climbing, plants in jar workshop)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The more people involved, the better! Experiences that interest multiple people are prioritised over those that only interest a few.</p>
      <p>Planning an activity is as easy as suggesting it to Alin, optionally (but preferably!) including a list of people you think would be interested.
