This is a static site to encourage Neontribers to use the Fun Budget.

## Setup

Download or clone the repository, navigate to it in your file browser and open `index.html` with a web browser.

## Adding past experiences to the site

1. Open `index.html` in the programming app of your choice
2. Scroll to "Past Experiences" (alternatively you may search for it if you're in a hurry)
3. **At the top** of the experiences, just below the current year, add a brief description of the gift or experience.
4. This should result in all experiences being listed in reverse chronological order - to ease the process you may want to add the date in brackets at the end of your description
